## Arm swing

"Most  people  jump using  their  upper  limbs and  arm  swing has  been  found  to 
increase  vertical  jump  height  by  about  10%  compared  to  jumping without  an  arm  swing 
(Feltner et al. 1999; Harman et al. 1990; Shetty & Etnyre 1989)."

Swinging in a circular motion seems to be better than moving in
a straight line from bottom positon to the upmost position.
A reason might be that a circumference is larger than the lenght of a straight path,
and so there is more time to accelerate the arm.
